# Azure-CloudBased-SIEM
This project demonstrates a simulated vulnerable Azure VM environment to showcase how Azure Sentinel, Microsoftâ€™s cloud-native SIEM, detects and visualizes potential attacker activity.

- We have set up an Azure Subscription with **a publicly exposed Virtual Machine** (firewalls have been disabled for simulating a **_HoneyPot_**.
- The attack requests are logged (in Powershell) and then ingested into **Azure Log Analytics Workspace.**
- Leveraged **Azure Sentinel** to map and monitor the requests being generated geographically.
- This helps visualise attacker behavior on a real-time dashboard, including **geolocation-based threat detection**.


### Features of SIEM:
- Configure alerts based on specific threat conditions or patterns.

- Ingest failed login data into Azure Sentinel to visualize attack origins and identify malicious activity by geographic location.


### Geographical Location Identification:

- Normally, logs in Windows machine are fetched from `Event Viewer`.
    ![1749513325546](image/README/1749513325546.png)
- However, when those logs are extracted, we don't have any details related to the "location" i.e., _where are the requests being made from?_.

- So, using a 3rd party API - `https://ipgeolocation.io/` and custom script , we fetch the location details for the associated log.


### Implementation

- After the Azure VM is configured with Azure Sentinel, we connect to the VM via RDP. 
- As different users try to login to the windows VM, the `failed activity` gets logged. Vieweing those logs in the `Event Viewer` =>

    ![1749513873593](image/README/1749513873593.png)

- Designed a *custom script* to use the IP address (from Event Viewer Log) and external 3rd party API to fetch the latitude/longitude details.

### Log Analysis - Azure Log Analytics Workspace
- Performed Log Analysis on the fetched logs from **failed login attempts** as shown below :

    ![1749514152132](image/README/1749514152132.png)<br>

- Used a **custom KQL query** to extract `latitude and longitude` data from logs, identifying the geographical origin of incoming attacks.
    ```
    Query Used =>
    FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL
    | extend username = extract(@"username:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
            timestamp = extract(@"timestamp:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
            latitude = extract(@"latitude:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
            longitude = extract(@"longitude:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
            sourcehost = extract(@"sourcehost:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
            state = extract(@"state:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
            label = extract(@"label:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
            destination = extract(@"destinationhost:([^,]+)", 1, RawData),
            country = extract(@"country:([^,]+)", 1, RawData)
        | where destinationhost = "honeypot-vm"
        | where sourcehost != ""
        | summarize event_count=count() by timestamp, label, country, state, sourcehost, username, destination, longitude, latitude

    ```

- Mapped the **country of origin** to each **IP address** to visualize and analyze the source of malicious activity.

#### Sample Log 
```
latitude:54.89029,longitude:23.92775,destinationhost:honeypot-vm,username:Administrator,sourcehost:91.238.181.31,state:Kauno Apskritis, country:Lithuania,label:Lithuania - 91.238.181.31,timestamp:2025-01-13 21:23:46
```
